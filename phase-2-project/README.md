My Phase 2 Project

This is a simple single HTML page with 3 client-side routes to: Home, Classes, and an About Us Page.
The Home page is a static HTML page with general information about the buisness.
The Classes Page is composed of components from the ClassesContainer.js and Classess.js which complie a page that show all the classess this buisness has to offer which is stored in a JSON-Server.
The About Us page stores the staff's names, info, descriptions, and likes of all members from the JSON-Server and has a like button the patched the likes and a controlled form that creates a new staff member and adds them to the page.
